Welcome to my portfolio. Here you will find future projects that will help me hone the skills needed to build successfully functioning sites. 
<br>
Totonki Tortilla Warmers is a one-of-a-kind shop built by my mom. She has been selling her homemade tortilla warmers on Etsy and local craft fairs. I would love for her to have her very own site. 
<br>
Delilah's Delights will be a site for a friend to sell her macarons. Currently she sells through Instagram and would like a proper store front of her own. 
<br>
Granillo & Co. will be a site built for a friend so that she can start her own businness as a private therapist. 
<br>
Finally, Rate that Restroom is an idea I had many, many years ago. Because of my health issues, I often found myself urgently needing a restroom. There were some that were great for noise suppression and ventillation, and some that left me feeling embarrased. However, I noticed that a lot these restrooms were not what they seemed on the outside. Thus, I thought it would be great for people to give a rating to a public restroom they visited to inform future pit=stoppers of what to expect.

Here is the link to my portfolio site. It should be updated with better graphics, responsiveness, and information as my skills improve.
